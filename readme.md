# MyBubble

Social distancing is an important safety measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a wealth of technology at our fingertips we are able to better prepare and organize our lives to accomodate the necessary precautions during these unprecedented times.


## Welcome to MyBubble
----- 
MyBubble is a web-based app that uses your mobile device's camera to display your personal bubble, or multiple bubbles, to help us keep physically distanced. We utilized [echoAR](https://www.echoar.xyz/) to create our AR social distancing hack.

## What we'll do next 
-----
Looking forward we would implement a way to measure the exact distance between bubbles. We also wanted to allow the user to place or save their spaced out bubbles for later use based on where they need them. Our future goals would include expanding this app to allow businesses to have a way of directing customers using a QR code they can scan to see where the bubbles have been placed. Another possible goal was to make this interactive and have the bubbles pop if you got to close to someone else, if this happened you would need to go back to a safe distance.
